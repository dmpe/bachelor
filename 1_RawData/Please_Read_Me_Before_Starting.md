## rJava vs. readxl

In my thesis I describe and write only about `rJava` library which is necessary for reading Excel files. Thus, in this folder 

- FreedomIndex.R
- HIndex.R
- LearningCurve.R
- WEF.R

all are using this package. For the sake of convinience (and the case something won't work) I have also prepared another implementation of those files using `readxl` package which DOES NOT require `rJava`.

For that the user is asked to unzip `.zip` folder and overwrite those 4 files (make backup somewhere).
