This repo contains source code, which I have used for my bachelor's thesis on creating my own composite indicator: "Attractiveness index of global economies". 

Thesis can be download here <> and please feel free to contact me if needed. Any corrections or suggestions may (and probably even will!) be done.

## rJava Installation

The installation process (on Ubuntu) can be quite pathetic. So take a long breath and submit problems to <https://github.com/s-u/rJava>. To make rJava work, use google (and stackoverflow). 

Always install official java 8 from oracle and less official "openjdk-8". Don't forget to run R CMD javareconf (-e). Maybe this will also help <http://stackoverflow.com/a/21504335>
