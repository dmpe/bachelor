Bachelor's Thesis: The Attractiveness Index of Global Economies
========

This repo contains the source code, which I have used for my bachelor's thesis when creating my own composite indicator: [*The Attractiveness Index of Global Economies*](https://dmpe.github.io/PapersAndArticles/). 

My thesis can be download here <https://dmpe.github.io/PapersAndArticles/> and please feel free to contact me if needed. Any corrections or suggestions may (and probably even will!) be done.

My website <https://indestat.wordpress.com/contact-me>.

As a small exercise (before I even started with the work) I have created <http://rpubs.com/F789GH/SingaporesEducation> (btw. you will need to look <https://gist.github.com/dmpe/b8c3f74d1e937d90b20f> for the code as the link inside is wrong).

## rJava Installation

The installation process (on Ubuntu) can be quite pathetic. So take a long breath and submit problems to <https://github.com/s-u/rJava> (as of 2015, he seems to have aboned it). To make rJava work, use google and stackoverflow. 

Always install official java 8 from oracle and less *official* "openjdk-8". Don't forget to run R CMD javareconf (-e) too! Maybe this will also help <http://stackoverflow.com/a/21504335>

Or, at last use some other package too: <https://github.com/hadley/readxl>
